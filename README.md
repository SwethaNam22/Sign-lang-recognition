Sign Language Recognition System (SLRS) 🤖
-----------------------
Motivation 💡
Sign language is a powerful means of communication for individuals with hearing disabilities. It bridges the gap between the hearing and deaf communities, empowering people to connect with the world around them. 
In this project, I aim to build a system that can accurately recognize and classify sign language gestures, making it easier for people with hearing disabilities to interact with others and access information seamlesly.

This project leverages the power of machine learning algorithms to bring us one step closer to a more inclusive world 🌍.
-----------------------
Objective 🎯
In this project, we explore the experimental analysis of several machine learning algorithms for Sign Language Recognition. Specifically, we compare the performance of the following algorithms:
XGBoost 🌱
LightGBM 💡
Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🔲
Decision Tree 🌳
Random Forest 🌲

The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of each algorithm in recognizing sign language gestures accurately.

Workflow 🔄
-->Data Preprocessing & Augmentation:
We load and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Image augmentation is applied to the training dataset to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.
Data preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance the features and prepare the images for the model.

-->Feature Extraction:
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) layers are used for better feature extraction from the images. This helps the models learn essential patterns from the gestures effectively.

-->Training ML Models:
The following machine learning algorithms are trained on the processed data:
XGBoost
LightGBM
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
-----------------------------
-->Future Improvements 🚀
Integration of Deep Learning Models (like CNNs) for better accuracy.
Real-time recognition through video input.
Expanding the dataset for more sign gestures and real-world testing.
Random Forest
Model Evaluation:
After training the models, we use the test dataset to evaluate each algorithm’s performance.
A classification report is generated, and accuracy metrics are provided for each model.
